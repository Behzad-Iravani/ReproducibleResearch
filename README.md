# ReproducibleResearch

This repository supports [Kirstie's](https://github.com/KirstieJane/) presentation on tips and tricks for making your research reproducible.

The goal is to build a directory of useful links, and a jargon busting glossary.

## Guide for contributors

See our [guidelines](https://github.com/KirstieJane/ReproducibleResearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute to the project.

A good place to start is to build the [Jargon Buster](https://github.com/KirstieJane/ReproducibleResearch/blob/master/Glossary.md) glossary. Pick a word you remember learning (preferably related to Reproducible Research but not necessarily), define it and submit a pull request so everyone else can learn with you!

Alternatively, you could add a resource to our [Resources](https://github.com/KirstieJane/ReproducibleResearch/blob/master/Resources.md) page. If there's a link you've found helpful, please add it to the list and submit a pull request to share with the community.

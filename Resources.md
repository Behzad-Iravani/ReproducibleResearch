### Git & GitHub

* [Friendly GitHub Introdution](https://kirstiejane.github.io/friendly-github-intro/): an afternoon workshop created originally by [Joey Lee](https://github.com/joeyklee) for the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/) and further developed by [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane) and [Anne Pajon](https://github.com/pajanne).

* [Get private GitHub repositories](https://education.github.com/): a [paid GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/what-plan-should-i-choose/) allows you to have private repositories that only people you choose to make collaborators can see. If you're a member of an academic institution you can [request a discount](https://education.github.com/) (to $0) and therefore have free private repositories. The discount lasts for 2 years but you can request another at the end of that period no problem :raised_hands:.

### Community

* [Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/): Mozilla Science Lab is a community of researchers, developers, and librarians making research open and accessible. Weâ€™re empowering open science leaders through fellowships, mentorship, and project-based learning. They have a community call on 3rd Thursday of the month. Check out their [events page](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events) for more details. 

* [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/): Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose goal is to make scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching them basic computing skills. Founded in 1998, it runs short, intensive workshops that cover program design, version control, testing, and task automation.

* [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/): Data Carpentry is a sibling organisation to Software Carpentry that focuses on developing and teaching workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research.

# Contributing Guidelines


Welcome to the Reproducible Research GitHub repository, and thank you for thinking about contributing! :smiley::heart::smiley:

The point of this file is to make it suuuuuper easy for you to get involved. So if you have any questions that aren't covered here please let us know! Check out the [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts) section below for more details.

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

Scroll down or jump to one of the following sections:

* [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts)
* [Make a change](#make-a-change)
* [Get in touch](#how-to-get-in-touch)

## Share your thoughts

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team.

GitHub has a nice set of help pages if you're looking for more information about [discussing projects in issues][link_discussingissues].

If you have a question or aren't sure about how to get started, please take a look through the issues to see if anyone else has asked the same thing, and if they haven't start a new one and ask away! :smiley:

## Make a change

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a new issue or a comment to an existing issue.

    [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.
    
2. [Fork][link_fork] the [Reproducible Research repository][link_reproducibleresearchrepo] to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.
    
    Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create [separate branches][link_branches] for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].
    
    [Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane/) will review your changes, maybe have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley::tada::sparkles:


## How to get in touch

If you have a question or a comment we'd love for you to [open an issue][link_issues] because that will be our fastest way of communicating, getting the answers to you and (if necessary) making a change.

If you'd prefer email you can contact [Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane) at kw401 AT cam DOT ac DOT uk. She's a postdoc who is gloriously overworked (who isn't?!), so please be gentle in your correspondence and give her a couple of days to reply. If she doesn't reply to your email before or during her regular "office hours" on Tuesday afternoons please feel free to ping her again.

## Thank you!

You are awesome. :heart_eyes::sparkles::sunny:
